## 🧠 Brain Tumour Classification — Phase 1 (CNN Model)

This project focuses on detecting and classifying brain tumours using deep learning techniques. In **Phase 1**, we implement a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to perform supervised image classification on a labelled MRI dataset.

### 🔍 What This Phase Covers

* Preprocessing and loading a brain tumour MRI dataset
* Implementing a **basic CNN architecture** for image classification
* Training the model for **10 epochs** to establish a baseline performance
* Evaluating the results using:

  * **Accuracy & loss curves**
  * **Confusion Matrix** to visualize class-wise performance

### 🎯 Objective

The goal of Phase 1 is to build a simple, functional pipeline to understand the dataset, model behaviour, and initial classification accuracy. This acts as the foundation for more advanced models and optimization in later phases.
